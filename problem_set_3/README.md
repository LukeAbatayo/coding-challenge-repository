# Problem Set X: Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Solution Overview

I created a new array where each index corresponds to the number of subsequences initiated from the "inputNumbers" array with the corresponding index number in the new array. And then from than new array, retrieved the largest amount.

## Instructions to Run the Code

From a linux command line, navigate to ".\coding-challenge-repository\problem_set_3", then run "node longest_increasing_subsequence.js"
